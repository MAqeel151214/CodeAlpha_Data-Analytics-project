# 📈 Module 3: Data Visualization

## 🎯 Objective
To translate statistical numbers into visual stories that provide actionable business insights.

## 🖼️ Visualizations Included

### 1. Price Density by Rating (Violin Plot)
*   **Goal:** To see the distribution of prices within each star rating.
*   **Insight:** The shape of the pricing distribution is identical across all ratings, confirming that pricing is random regarding quality.

### 2. Title Length vs. Price (Hexbin Joint Plot)
*   **Goal:** To test the hypothesis that "Complex titles cost more."
*   **Insight:** The density is concentrated in the center; no linear trend exists between title length and price.

### 3. Top Keywords (Bar Chart)
*   **Goal:** Text mining analysis of the most common words in book titles.
*   **Insight:** Helps the marketing team understand the current inventory mix (e.g., prevalence of specific genres).

*   **Seaborn:** For statistical styling (Violin, Joint plots).
*   **Matplotlib:** For base plotting and figure sizing.
*   **Collections:** For word frequency counting.
